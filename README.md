# statsCalculator
Simple program to find the sum, average, max, min and distance between two user entered numbers created as part of an introductory Java course.

How statsCalculator Works:

The program prompts the user for two integers and then calculates the sum and average of the two numbers. Utilizes the math objects methods for max, min, and absolute value (to find the distance).

Other Notes: 
Does not have anything in place to handle exceptions, will crash if user input is anything besides and integeer. To be a better functioning program should have if/else or try/catch block added.
